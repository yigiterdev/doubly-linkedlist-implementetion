# C Playlist with Doubly Linkedlist Implementetion

In this assignment I wrote, I created a struct named Song and used the Doubly LinkedList structure to go back and forth comfortably. Here I kept the music name and structures like next prev.
I defined hasNext and hasPrev as extra functions. These allow me to navigate the playlist comfortably and play the necessary song. I have defined them with the iterator logic in Java. The other 6 functions execute the given commands. Type of 8 functions void
type and a value is not returned. reversePlaylist is Song \* type and returns the translated version of the playlist. hasNext and hasPrev return 1 and 0 depending on whether they are next or prev.
